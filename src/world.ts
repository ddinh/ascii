/* This is sort of kind of a world "system" 

Notes about what this World class could or should be:

- keep things related to generating the initial world state (?)
- leave propagation of the simulation to another system
- in theory, if users are to specify custom "factors" into the way their world is generated, 
    then those factors would be tweaked here... (maybe?)
    - but, maybe this would be better left for a "Generator" class
        - it could generate types of rooms/dungeons?
